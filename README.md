Hi! Welcome to my blog page! üê∏

My name is Friedrich Vock, I'm 18 years old, and I like everything low-level, Linux, and GPUs, which I occasionally blog about here.

In parallel to studying Computer Science at the University of Konstanz I'm working as an independent contractor for Valve on RADV, the community-developed open-source Vulkan driver for AMD GPUs.

If you want to reach out, I linked my accounts on various social media platforms in the bottom right corner.
